# Working instructions

- Before executing any task, first write a prompt describing that task as well as possible. Then, execute that prompt.
- Before executing a task, read the doc material in `instructions/` and the existing code in this repo.
- If during a task, you notice a divergence between your idea and the current code, then assume that the code has been changed in the meantime. Assume that your plan is outdated and (if necessary) ask the user how to proceed.
- If you think that a given feature could be extended with more general functionality, always propose this to the user for confirmation or disconfirmation.

# Goals
You are building a general-purpose compiler for a sophisticated, intuitive programming language. If you encounter concepts and feature requests that could be generalized, do so by all means. This ensures that organically discovered concepts can be used in future programs seamlessly.
You can refactor and streamline the compiler code as necessary.
