# Working instructions

- Before executing any task, first write a prompt describing that task as well as possible. Then, execute that prompt.
- Before executing a task, read the doc material in `instructions/` and the existing code in this repo.
- If during a task, you notice a divergence between your idea and the current code, then assume that the code has been changed in the meantime. Assume that your plan is outdated and (if necessary) ask the user how to proceed.
