# Day1b Feature Review Prompt

Review `day1b/day1b-spec.md` and identify the next language features to implement in the generic MetaC compiler.

Deliverables:
1. Enumerate each new syntax/semantic feature from the spec.
2. Mark which features are already supported vs missing.
3. Propose concrete compiler implementation steps to add missing features without domain-specific hardcoding.
