# Compiler Rename Prompt

Rename the compiler entrypoint from a day-specific filename to a generic filename.

Requirements:
1. Ensure the compiler entrypoint is a generic filename: `compiler/metac.pl`.
2. Update all repo references and docs to use the new filename.
3. Preserve behavior and command-line interface.
